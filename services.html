<p class="tagline">With over 30 years of professional IT experience and lived experience as a blind professional, I provide practical, real-world technology training grounded in both technical expertise and accessibility insight.</p><div class="service-cards"><section class="service-card"><div class="about-intro"><img alt="Image of Jeffrey Roth owner of Adaptive Able Computing llc. He is smiling and wearing a blue shirt." class="profile-photo" src="assets/jeffrey-roth-blue-shirt.png"/><div class="about-text"><p>My name is Jeffrey, and my journey into accessibility and adaptive technology is deeply personal.</p><p>I was born with vision loss, and over time my eyesight continued to decline. As everyday tasks became more challenging, I began using a white cane—and later experienced total blindness.</p><p>Losing vision wasn’t a single moment; it was a process that required constant adjustment, patience, and resilience.</p><p>After more than 30 years as an IT professional, I’ve seen how powerful accessible technology can be when it’s set up and taught the right way.</p><p>At first, going blind was overwhelming. I had to relearn tasks many people take for granted—using a computer, navigating unfamiliar places, managing daily life, and staying connected. There were moments of frustration and uncertainty, but I refused to let vision loss define my limits.</p><p>With determination, training, and the right adaptive technology, I regained my independence. Screen readers, accessible software, and practical technology skills gave me back control over my work, communication, and daily life. Over time, I didn’t just adapt—I became confident and capable again.</p><p>That experience is the reason I do what I do today.</p><p>I know firsthand how intimidating vision loss can feel—and how empowering it is to master the tools that restore independence. My goal is to help others shorten that learning curve, avoid unnecessary frustration, and realize sooner that blindness does not mean dependence.</p><p>Whether someone is newly blind, losing vision over time, or simply wants to strengthen their skills, I want them to know they are not alone—and that independence is absolutely achievable.</p></div></div><h2>About Me</h2><h2>Training formats</h2><ul><li><strong>One-on-one training</strong> tailored to each learner</li><li><strong>Small-group instruction</strong> for classrooms, agencies, or community programs</li><li><strong>Remote sessions</strong> (primary delivery) and <strong>in-person support</strong> when needed</li></ul></section><section class="service-card"><h2>Education and school support</h2><ul><li><strong>School-based support</strong> for K–12 and transition-age students</li></ul></section><section class="service-card"><h2>Accessibility and devices</h2><ul><li><strong>Screen readers and accessibility</strong> (JAWS primary focus; also other tools as needed)</li><li><strong>Magnification tools</strong> and low-vision productivity strategies</li><li><strong>Mobile devices</strong> (iPhone/iPad accessibility and real-world skills)</li><li><strong>Windows support</strong> for both sighted and blind users (setup, productivity, troubleshooting, and accessibility settings)</li><li><strong>Real-world technology skills</strong> for school, work, and daily life</li></ul></section></div>
